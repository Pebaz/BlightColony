	6. How To Play screen

From there, created the art and the levels using the same componenets as the
previous levels.


-> Main Menu

Level 1 ->
	"Nodibu is running for his life after inadvertently insulting the honor of
	the mushroom king. He will stop at nothing to see that his infraction has
	been rectified."

	"Orange Gorfs hurt very little but add an entire minute onto your timer
	if they hit you."

Level 2 ->
	"After fending off countless Gorfs, Nodibu managed to slip away from the
	main group and head into the desert, where he accidentally regained the
	attention of his formidable foes."

	"Red Gorfs will hunt you down and fire poison balls at you."

Level 3 ->
	"Gorf after Gorf he slew, until the entrance to an underground cave caught
	Nodibu's eye. With the aim of having a more defensible position, he
	entered."

	"Green Gorfs generate large pools of poisonous liquid, don't step in
	them."

Level 4 ->
	"As Nodibu's fatigue grew commensurate to the depth of the cave, he came
	across a lava fountain. Being that deep within the earth was not without
	its dangers."

	"Blue Gorfs will use their very large hands to pound the ground and cause
	a huge shockwave."

Level 5 ->
	"Emerging through a dormant volcano tube, Nodibu discovered the remains
	of an ancient arctic civilization."

	"Yellow Gorfs will fire blasts of Lyrium energy at you, don't let them
	corner you."


"After running for nearly 5 days, Nodibu had finally vanquished the last of his
pursuers. Next time, when in the presence of a king, Nodibu decided that he
would probably just keep his mouth shut."
